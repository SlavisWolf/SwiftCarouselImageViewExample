# SwiftCarouselImageViewExample
An example implementing a carousel of images coexisting with other views inside a view controller. I have done this carousel using a UICollectionView with horizontal scrolling and a UIPageControl to see the total number of cells in the carousel and the current cell is displaying at the moment. 
We can active a timer for scroll the collection view to the next cell(the last cell return to the first) we can UISwitch
